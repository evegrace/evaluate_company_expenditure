"# evaluate_company_expenditure" 
Evaluation of a Company’s Expenditure in Salaries.
This is an analysis of a company’s expenditure on salaries or compensation which is usually (40-80) % of a company’s gross income as per the Society for Human Rights Management. 
Installations
A typical python package with numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot is all that is necessary so far to execute the code
Project Motivation
I have just started a data science course, and have always been curious as to the factors that pertain to one’s valued depicted by the compensation received. I hope this is merely a start and that it expands as my knowledge of data science increases. I am planning on publishing my results in medium, and I am open for any suggestions to deepen the analysis.
Looking at understanding a company’s salary or compensation expenditure, Read about it on my blog post.

CRISP-DM Questions
My initial questions for this dataset where
1.	How is over 50% of the company's gross income spent?
2.	Is it worth it?
3.	What can a starting employee expect in the next few years or so?
Evaluation of Results
1.	Job level, Years at work, Age are some of the main elements that influence one’s salary or compensation.
2.	These generally depict of knowledge and expertise that anyone should strive to obtain in relation to their career.
3.	The year 2015 stood out with unusual attributes, but generally,non-substantial deductions were made.
Deploy
I hope the results can be used to further the analysis , with data modeling also being updated over time.
